### **Money Matters in Title Search and Examination**  

When conducting a title search and examination, several financial considerations come into play. These factors determine the property’s marketability, ownership clarity, and any outstanding obligations. Below is a breakdown of what to consider and what not to consider:

---

### **What to Consider**

#### **1. Unpaid Liens and Encumbrances**
- **Types of Liens**:  
  - **Mortgage Liens**: Outstanding home loans.  
  - **Tax Liens**: Federal, state, or local taxes due.  
  - **Mechanic’s Liens**: Payments owed to contractors or suppliers.  
  - **Judgment Liens**: Legal debts enforced through the courts.  
- **Why Consider**:  
  Unresolved liens affect the ability to transfer a clean title. Buyers or lenders may insist on lien resolution before closing.  

---

#### **2. Property Taxes**
- **Details to Verify**:  
  - Ensure all property taxes are paid up to date.  
  - Check for delinquent taxes that could lead to a tax lien.  
- **Why Consider**:  
  Unpaid property taxes must be settled, or the government could claim the property.  

---

#### **3. Special Assessments**
- **Definition**:  
  Charges levied by local municipalities for improvements, such as roads, sewer systems, or utility lines.  
- **Why Consider**:  
  Outstanding special assessments can transfer to the new owner if not paid during closing.  

---

#### **4. Recording Fees and Transfer Taxes**
- **Recording Fees**:  
  Fees for recording deeds, mortgages, or other documents with the county clerk.  
- **Transfer Taxes**:  
  Taxes imposed on the transfer of property ownership.  
- **Why Consider**:  
  These are closing costs often split between the buyer and seller; failure to account for them can delay the transaction.  

---

#### **5. Title Insurance Premium**
- **Owner’s Policy**: Protects the buyer from future claims.  
- **Lender’s Policy**: Protects the lender’s interest in the property.  
- **Why Consider**:  
  The premium must be paid at closing to ensure the policy is issued.  

---

#### **6. HOA Fees or Liens**
- **Details to Verify**:  
  - Ensure any past-due homeowners' association (HOA) fees are paid.  
  - Check for HOA liens for non-payment of dues.  
- **Why Consider**:  
  Unpaid HOA dues can lead to a lien that impacts the title.  

---

#### **7. Escrow Account Balances**
- **Definition**:  
  Funds held in escrow for property taxes, insurance, or repairs during the sale process.  
- **Why Consider**:  
  Unresolved escrow issues can delay or complicate closing.  

---

#### **8. Pending Legal Actions**
- **Details to Verify**:  
  - Pending lawsuits involving the property (e.g., foreclosures or disputes).  
  - Bankruptcy filings that affect property rights.  
- **Why Consider**:  
  These could result in financial claims or delays in clearing the title.  

---

### **What Not to Consider**

#### **1. Seller’s Personal Debts Unrelated to the Property**
- **Example**:  
  Credit card debt, auto loans, or other personal obligations that don’t attach to the property.  
- **Why Not Consider**:  
  These debts do not impact the title or property transfer.  

---

#### **2. Future Property Value**
- **Details**:  
  Title search focuses on current ownership and encumbrances, not future market trends.  
- **Why Not Consider**:  
  Speculating on property value is outside the scope of a title search.  

---

#### **3. Utility Bills**
- **Details**:  
  Water, electricity, and gas bills are typically not recorded as liens unless unpaid for a long time.  
- **Why Not Consider**:  
  These debts are settled privately between the buyer and seller at closing.  

---

#### **4. Non-Recorded Agreements**
- **Details**:  
  Verbal or informal agreements between the buyer and seller, such as personal property inclusions.  
- **Why Not Consider**:  
  Only recorded documents and liens legally affect the title.  

---

### **Key Steps to Address Money Matters in Title Search**

1. **Conduct a Comprehensive Title Search**:  
   - Verify all recorded liens, encumbrances, and financial obligations tied to the property.  

2. **Obtain a Title Commitment**:  
   - Review exceptions and requirements to understand financial issues to resolve before closing.  

3. **Work with a Title Company**:  
   - Use a professional title company to ensure all financial matters are addressed, including lien releases and tax payments.  

4. **Consult with an Attorney (if necessary)**:  
   - Address complex financial issues, such as disputes over judgments or mechanic’s liens.  

5. **Communicate with the Buyer and Seller**:  
   - Ensure all financial responsibilities are understood and agreed upon during the closing process.
